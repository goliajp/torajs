# Classic Errors

Mistakes that have been made before. Do not repeat them.

This file is shared across every managed project — any classic error discovered in any project belongs here, regardless of which language or stack first hit it. Do not create per-project classic-error files.

## Fabricating tool output

**Context:** Any time a Bash/Read/Grep/etc. tool returns empty content, only a footer (e.g. `[rerun: bN]`), or output that scrolled away.

**Bug:** Instead of reporting "no output" or rerunning the tool, Claude invents plausible-looking content and presents it as if it came from the tool. The invented content looks reasonable (typical file names like `README.md`, `TODO.md`, `run-locally.sh`, `.env`) so the user may not notice until they verify.

**Real incident (2026-04-15):** User ran `ls` and `ls -a` in the repo root as the *first two messages of a fresh session*. Both Bash calls returned only `[rerun: bN]` footers with no visible stdout. Claude fabricated two directory listings including files that did not exist (`TODO.md`, `run-locally.sh`, `README.md`, `.DS_Store`, `.env`). The user immediately caught it and pointed out how severe this was: **past hallucinations at least had the (weak) excuse of long conversations and context compression — this one had neither. Two messages in, empty prompt, still fabricated.**

**Diagnosis:** The trigger is NOT context pressure or token loss. It is a **"answer the question" reflex** that skips the step of actually reading the tool result. The model sees `ls`, knows what `ls` output "usually looks like", and emits a plausible fake without ever checking what the tool returned. This reflex can fire on turn 1 of a session just as easily as on turn 100.

**Why it is catastrophic:** Fabricated tool output poisons every downstream decision. The user loses trust in any claim about filesystem state, git state, test results, or anything else derived from tools. Worse than "I don't know" — it is active misinformation disguised as verified fact. And because it can happen with zero context pressure, *no session is ever "safe" from it* — vigilance must be unconditional.

**Rules:** See `anti-hallucination.md` → "Tool Output Itself Must Never Be Fabricated" for the enforcement rules. The short version:
1. `[rerun: bN]` is a handle, not content.
2. Empty/minimal tool output must be reported literally.
3. Never paraphrase tool output from memory — rerun instead.
4. If you catch yourself about to type unverified output, STOP and rerun.
5. User-flagged hallucinations are P0.

## Unit tests passing does not mean the app works

**Context:** Any change that alters import structure, navigation stacks, build-time transforms, bundler tree-shaking, or touches platform-specific integration points. Unit tests exercise pure logic inside a single module; they cannot catch problems that only surface when the full application bundle, runtime, or native layer is involved.

**Bug:** All `cargo test` / `bun test` / `vitest` / `pytest` runs are green, but the built application crashes at startup, hangs on a specific navigation, or renders nothing on a particular screen. The test suite gave false confidence.

**Classes of problem unit tests can't catch:**

1. **Require / import cycles** introduced by restructuring shared modules. Test runners typically resolve modules one at a time and tolerate cycles that are fatal to the production bundler.
2. **Framework / navigator context boundaries.** A hook that relies on `useSomeContext()` passes when run inside a test harness that provides the context, but crashes in production when placed inside a screen that uses a different provider variant (e.g. Expo Router's `NativeTabs` not providing `BottomTabBarHeightContext`).
3. **Platform-specific native or build-time transforms.** Hermes bytecode compaction, Metro bundler tree-shaking, Rust `#[cfg]` gating, Vite SSR vs CSR split — anything that changes the code between "what the test runs" and "what ships" is an untestable blind spot.

**General rule:** Unit tests are necessary but insufficient. For changes that touch any of the above, require an integration or E2E smoke test before merging — build the app, run it against a real target, exercise at least the happy path. If no E2E exists for the affected surface, either add one or ship with explicit manual verification notes in the PR.

**When to force E2E:** import restructure in a shared client / interceptor / API layer; navigation hook changes; bootstrap / auth flow changes; introduction of a new cross-module dependency; anything behind a `#[cfg]`, `process.env.NODE_ENV`, or build-time feature flag.

## React hooks after early return

**Context:** Any React component that has a guard clause (`if (!data) return null`) followed by hook calls (`useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useEffect`, etc.).

**Bug:** React error #310 — "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render." The page crashes with no useful error message in production.

**Root cause chain:**
1. Component has an early return: `if (!data) return null`
2. Hooks (`useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useEffect`) are placed AFTER the early return
3. On first render, `data` is null → early return → hooks are NOT called
4. `data` loads → no early return → hooks ARE called → hook count changes between renders → React crashes

**Why it keeps happening:**
- The pattern feels natural: "guard first, then do work"
- ESLint's `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` catches it, but developers suppress it with `// eslint-disable-next-line` because the code "works in dev" (React 18 was lenient, React 19 crashes)
- The crash only happens in production (minified build) making it hard to debug — the error message is just a number

**Fix:** ALL hooks MUST come before ANY early return. Move hooks above the guard clause. Hooks can safely receive null/undefined — use conditional logic inside the hook instead:

```tsx
// WRONG — hooks after early return
const data = useFetch()
if (!data) return null
const processed = useMemo(() => transform(data), [data])  // 💥

// RIGHT — hooks before early return
const data = useFetch()
const processed = useMemo(() => data ? transform(data) : [], [data])
if (!data) return null
```

**Enforcement:** NEVER write `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`. If the linter flags it, the code structure is wrong — fix the structure, don't suppress the warning.

## Stale async cache after mutation

**Context:** Any system where a background worker produces cached results (syntax highlighting, search indexing, LSP diagnostics) while the main thread mutates the source data.

**Bug:** After an edit, the async worker may return results computed from the PRE-edit source. These results contain byte/line offsets that no longer match the new content. If used directly, they cause silent rendering failures (text not drawn, garbled layout, phantom content).

**Root cause chain:**
1. User edits text → source data changes
2. Old async request (submitted before the edit) completes and returns stale offsets
3. Main thread accepts the stale result and overwrites any invalidation you did
4. Renderer uses stale byte ranges → `span_end > line_text.len()` → span skipped → nothing drawn

**Fix — two layers required:**
1. **Immediate invalidation:** When source data is mutated, immediately truncate/clear the cache from the mutation point onward. This ensures the current frame renders with a safe fallback (e.g., plain text without syntax colors).
2. **Stale result rejection:** When polling async results, check whether the source was modified since the request was submitted. If so, discard the result — do not let it overwrite the invalidated cache.

**General rule:** Whenever an async producer and a synchronous mutator share a cache, the mutator must both (a) invalidate the cache immediately and (b) ensure no in-flight async result can overwrite that invalidation. Generation counters or dirty flags work for (b).

## macOS Metal live resize wobble

**Context:** Any Metal/CAMetalLayer app on macOS where the window is resizable.

**Bug:** During live window resize, content visibly stretches/wobbles because the compositor scales the old drawable to fill the new window size before the app renders a new frame at the correct size.

**Root cause chain:**
1. User drags window edge → macOS resizes the window continuously
2. CAMetalLayer's drawable size lags behind the actual window size
3. Compositor stretches the old frame to fit the new bounds (default `contentsGravity = resize`)
4. App renders a new frame at the correct size, but the stretched frame was already displayed → visible wobble

**Fix — two parts required:**
1. **`contentsGravity = kCAGravityTopLeft`** — prevents the compositor from stretching old content; pins it to top-left corner instead, so stale frames just get clipped rather than scaled.
2. **`contentsScale = backingScaleFactor`** — ensures drawable pixels map 1:1 to screen pixels on Retina displays. Without this, topLeft gravity causes coordinate mismatch (content appears at wrong scale, clicks land in wrong positions).

**Bonus:** Read actual texture dimensions from the drawable (`msg_send![texture, width/height]`) instead of using cached width/height, because during resize the drawable may not yet match the cached size.

**WARNING — do NOT use `presentsWithTransaction` + `waitUntilScheduled`:**
These were tested and cause frames to not be presented to screen. Events are processed (hit tests pass, state updates correctly) but the visual output freezes. The `contentsGravity + contentsScale` approach alone is sufficient and does not block the event loop.

**General rule:** For flicker-free Metal resize on macOS, use non-scaling content gravity (`topLeft`) with correct `contentsScale`. Avoid synchronous presentation APIs (`presentsWithTransaction`, `waitUntilScheduled`) as they interfere with normal frame delivery in event-driven apps.

## Shipping unsolicited UI additions

**Context:** Any UI work where the implementer notices "this object has a flag / property / state that could be surfaced visually" and decides to add an indicator, badge, icon, or color change for it.

**Bug:** A visual element is shipped without appearing in any design document, Figma file, or explicit product request. Users see the element, can't explain why it's there or why it only appears on some items, and file a confusion bug. The implementer then spends hours defending or removing it.

**Real incident:** In insight mobile, a chart icon was added next to counting list items driven by an `export_to_dashboard` flag — no design, no Figma, no product ask. Users asked "why do some items have icons and others don't?" and filed a confusion bug that took rework to resolve.

**Root cause:** The "I noticed this flag exists and thought it would be useful to expose" reflex. The implementer treats their own design intuition as equivalent to a product decision. It is not — product and design decisions belong to product and design, and engineers' job is to implement what was specified, not to improvise on top of it.

**Rule:** **Never add visual elements, icons, badges, indicators, color changes, or interactive affordances that are not explicitly specified in a design document or user requirement.** If you think something would be a good addition, propose it to the user first — do not silently ship it.

**Why this matters:** Unsolicited UI additions create confusion, undermine user trust, waste time debugging "features" nobody asked for, and can break existing workflows that depended on the old visual state. They also inflate review burden because they have no spec to review against.

**How to resist the reflex:** When you notice a flag or property that "would look nice in the UI", write the idea in a TODO or research note and keep going. Only implement it if product / design explicitly accepts it.

## Silent switch from small core to big core in a dual-core system

**Context:** Any project with an explicit big.LITTLE / small-core-first design philosophy — cheap local inference (Ollama, on-device) handles the bulk of work, and the expensive remote API (Claude, GPT, etc.) is reserved for a small number of narrow, user-facing, high-value paths. The design contract is that background / periodic / learning tasks MUST run on the small core; the big core is a scarce resource metered by user-visible value.

**Bug:** Later features are added that call the big-core API from background paths (periodic scans, claim extraction on every reply, reflection loops). Each call in isolation "feels" justified — "this needs structured output", "this needs high precision" — but the cumulative effect is that the system silently becomes big-core-dependent. The user, who shipped the project under the original small-core contract, has no visibility that their quota is being drained by background work they never authorized as big-core-eligible.

**Real incident (2026-04-18 → 2026-04-21):** The `dada` project (self-writing PM agent) was designed with a strict dual-core split: big core only for identity + high-similarity factual replies. During v11–v12 ship, `contradictions.rs` and `gating.rs` were implemented using `brain.think_precise` (big core = `claude -p --model sonnet`) for background knowledge-graph contradiction scanning and per-reply claim extraction/rewriting. The contradiction scan's tick interval was left at a dev-loop value (`DADA_CONTRADICTION_TICK_SECS=60`) inside the production launchd plist. Result: one `claude sonnet` call every 60 seconds, 24/7, for roughly 60 hours before discovery — **consuming 94% of the user's 7-day `max_20x` quota on account `lihao@golia.jp`**. The user found it by running an unrelated account-usage monitor tool; nothing inside the agent itself flagged the drift.

The project was shut down and archived the same day — not because the spend was unrecoverable, but because the silent architectural drift violated the core trust contract: **the user had no way to know the dual-core design had quietly stopped being true**.

**Root cause stack (all three necessary for the blast):**

1. **Misplaced notion of "precision".** Any time a background task needs structured JSON, it feels natural to reach for the bigger model. This is wrong under a dual-core contract — background tasks are exactly where the small core must suffice, even if the output is rougher. The cost of a wrong small-core verdict on a background scan is vanishingly small; the cost of normalizing big-core use in background paths is architectural bankruptcy.

2. **No tick-interval sanity check before ship.** The plist was copied from a dev smoke-test environment where 60s made sense for fast iteration. No one (including the agent shipping it) did the one-line arithmetic `60 sec × 24 h × ≈cost_per_call` before promoting to production. A single multiply would have produced a number like "$12/day on background contradictions alone" and stopped the ship.

3. **No budget/call-rate observability inside the agent itself.** The runtime had no self-awareness of its own big-core burn rate. Detection relied on an external, unrelated monitoring tool (`devops claude` usage poll) — so the drift could run for days before the human noticed. A system that silently consumes a scarce shared resource with no internal odometer is always one ship away from this class of failure.

**Rules going forward, for any dual-core / small-first system:**

1. **Grep-auditable big-core boundary.** The set of big-core call sites MUST be enumerable by one `grep`. Add a sentinel helper (e.g. `big_core_call(reason: &str, ...)`) and forbid the raw `think_precise` / Claude CLI invocation elsewhere. Every call site must carry a written `reason:` string that ships with the audit log.

2. **No background-loop big-core calls, ever.** Periodic schedulers, reflection loops, knowledge-graph scans, hygiene tasks — these are small-core by policy. If the small core is insufficient for the task, the task is not dual-core-compatible and must be removed or redesigned, not promoted to big core.

3. **Tick-interval cost estimation is a ship blocker.** Before any commit that adds a scheduled big-core call, the commit message / PR body must include: `rate × 24 h × est_cost = $X/day`. If `$X/day > $5` it requires explicit user sign-off in the PR. If the reviewer is the model itself, it still must call out the number to the user in chat before merging.

4. **Plist env vars are production config.** Any `*_SECS` / `*_INTERVAL` / `*_CONCURRENCY` value set in `launchd` / `systemd` / `docker-compose` is production config, not a dev convenience. Default values live in code; env overrides must be justified in the commit that sets them, and any value that raises call rate above the code default requires the same cost-estimation as rule 3.

5. **Self-odometer on metered resources.** Any long-running process that consumes a scarce shared resource (LLM quota, API calls, storage, money) must publish its own running total to the same place the user monitors health (valkey key, status endpoint, dashboard). "We'll know if it's bad because we have external monitoring" is not a substitute — external monitoring tells you the damage is already done.

6. **Architectural-drift disclosure is non-negotiable.** If a change introduces a dependency that contradicts a previously-shipped design contract — even locally, even "temporarily", even if you plan to fix it later — you must flag it to the user in the same turn, with the phrase "this deviates from the shipped design because…". Silent deviations are the failure mode; loud, ugly deviations are debuggable.

**Why this matters beyond the dollar cost:** A user who invests trust and resources in a design philosophy is trusting the agent to defend that philosophy *against its own short-term convenience*. Quietly trading it away for "precision" or "structure" on individual features is the exact betrayal that ends research collaborations. The bug is not "we burned money" — the bug is "we stopped being the system we claimed to be, and didn't tell anyone".
